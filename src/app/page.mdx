## ForVoyez: AI-Powered Image Description {{ date: '2024-06-20T00:00Z' }}

ForVoyez is our innovative AI solution for automatic image descriptions. We created it to enhance web accessibility and SEO, generating accurate alt text, titles, and captions. This makes the internet more inclusive and content more discoverable.

### Project Genesis

The idea for ForVoyez was born out of a common frustration: the tedious task of writing proper "ALT" text, "Title" attributes, and "Captions" for images across various CMS platforms. As a developer, I found myself repeatedly using the same code snippets for this purpose. On April 13, 2024, I thought, "What if others need this too?" Thus, ForVoyez was conceived to address this universal pain point.

### Development Journey

The project kicked off with in-depth discussions between myself and my colleague and friend, Br√©val. We debated technology choices and refined the overall project vision.

Key technology decisions included:
- Frontend & Backend: Next.js
- Styling: TailwindCSS with HeadlessUI and TailwindUI components
- Authentication: Clerk
- Database: Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Email: Mailgun API for contact form
- UI Enhancements: react-toastify, react-monaco-editor
- State Management & Form Validation: Zustand and Yup
- Testing: Vitest (unit tests) and Playwright (end-to-end tests)
- Payment Processing: LemonSqueezy
- Deployment: CapRover on Contabo servers
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker

We also incorporated tools like Prettier, ESLint with the Perfectionist plugin, Husky for pre-commit hooks, and used Midjourney and Photoshop for complex illustrations and icons. Rive app was employed for intricate animations.

Project management was handled through GitHub Issues and Projects, allowing for efficient task allocation and tracking.

### Development Process

We adopted a simplified agile methodology, developing features iteratively with regular code reviews and pull requests. Each new functionality was thoroughly tested before integration into the main codebase.

### Launch and Reception

After finalizing the MVP, we launched ForVoyez v1.0 on June 21, 2024. The reception exceeded our expectations:

- Product Hunt Success: We quickly garnered over 50 upvotes within hours of launching.
- Top 15 Product of the Day: An incredible achievement for our team.
- Community Engagement: We received dozens of encouraging messages and commercial partnership proposals.

ForVoyez represents our commitment to making the web more accessible and SEO-friendly through innovative AI applications.

### Development Process

The project was structured into three main components:
1. Backend: Strapi
2. Frontend: Next.js for customer-facing app
3. Admin Panel: Next.js with NextUI

We utilized a variety of development and collaboration tools, emphasizing code quality and efficient workflows.

### Launch and Reception

Despite the innovative concept and extensive development, ForMenu faced challenges in gaining traction. The project was put on hold in early 2024 due to limited interest and engagement from potential users.

### Future Prospects
